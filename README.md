### Hey, I'm Peter! 👋

I'm currently persuing a Master of Environmental Data Science degree at the Bren School at UCSB, where I'm learning how to address environmental problems with data science techniques using R and Python. I'm particularly interested in climate change mitigation strategies and emerging technologies in the environmental sector.
